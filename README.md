# Binary/Hex Number Translator

## Overview

For this exercise, you will need to create a program that can convert binary and hexidecimal numbers to their decimal representation.

For example,

`1010` translate to `10`
`5af1` translates to `23281`

You will read the numbers to convert from the `data.txt` file provided. You will write the converted numbers to a file called `solution.txt`.

## Requirements

- Program reads numbers from data.txt and converts them to their decimal equivalent
- Program writes solutions into a `solution.txt` file.
- You can use any functions available in your chosen framework's standard library (e.g node libraries for javascript, c++ standard library). You will not need any external library to implement a solution
- If you need a refresher on number conversions, see [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/how-binary-to-decimal.html) and [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/how-hex-to-decimal.html)
- It must pass with the provided numbers, but feel free to create additional test cases

## Notes/Tips

- All hexidecimal numbers are writen with a 0x prefix
- The input file may not be perfectly formatted, so consider that when reading in data
