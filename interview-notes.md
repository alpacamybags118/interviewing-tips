# Phases of A Software Engineering Interview (Generally)

## General Tips
- Dont be afraid of failure. Interviewing is a skill like anything else, and you have to get practice.
- Ask questions! You should be interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. You need to have a good understanding of how it would be to work there day-to-day so you can make the best choices for you. It also shows you take an interest in the position and company.

## Initial Recruiter Call

- Purpose is to see if you are a fit before sending you to a hiring manager or panel of interviewers
- They want to get an idea of your experience and skills, but generally aren't going to test you on them. if there are any technical questions, they will be light and focused on your experience

### Tips

- Have a 60 second "elevator pitch" for yourself ready
    - a bit about yourself
    - your skills and experience
    - what you are looking for in a role

## First Technical Exercise

Generally you will be given an initial screening technical exercise. This may be via a call with a hiring manager or given as something to do on your own time.

SE coding questions usually fall into a few categories

- Algorithm-based questions (e.g. Fibonacci )
- Data-structure based (e.g stack, queue)
- Programm Fundamentals (e.g for loops, if/else, functions, classes, etc)

They can either be in the form of "puzzles" or something that is more closer to work you would actually do on the job.

My tips differ depending on the format:

### Take-Home Assignment

- Generally, you will be on a timer once you start it so ensure you are in a distraction-free place and have 1-2 hours free
- Make sure all of your tools are ready ahead of time (IDE, stack overflow, etc). You want to ensure you are using the time to solve the problem rather than fight your tools
- Read through the problem multiple times. Since its take-home, the problems are generally very specific about what they want the solution to be, but it can sometimes be easy to miss requirements
- write comments explaining your logic and approach. often times, the interviewer is more interested in seeing your thought process and how you apporach problems, regardless if you finish the problem or not.

### Zoom/Phone

- Ensure you are in a quiet place with a stable internet connection
- The interviewer will likely start with introductions, then move on to either technical questions or a problem to solve/pair on

#### Technical Questions

The technical questions will likely be sourced from what you put on your resume and expectations of the knowledge of a new graduate. 

Be honest about your experience level if asked about experience with a tool. In entry level roles, this doesnt matter as much as their expectation is it will take time for you to begin providing value. But if you fib and they catch it, you're out of the process for sure.

Expect questions such as:

- how to do "x" in your programming language of choice
- Knowledge of general computer science topics
    - data structures (stack, queue, etc)
    - Big O notation
    - algorithms
    - interfaces, classes, inheritance, etc
- knowledge of your chosen programming language
    - features of language

#### Live Problem Solving

This is one of the hardest parts of the interview process as a whole. Your interviewer will generally either describe a problem to you and ask for a solution, or show you something that has a problem statement and solution requirements.

The biggest thing to remember here is NOT to just try to solve the problem as fast as possible! The person interviewing you often isnt as concerned about getting the right answer; but **how** you got there, and the collaboration between you and them.

Unless you are explicitly told you cannot use the interviewer as a resource, treat the person as someone you are pairing with. Ask questions to understand the problem more, talk through potential solutions and use them as a sounding board.

They want to get a gauge of how you can collaborate on the job, along with understanding your problem solving skills.

The types of problems given are problems that you should be able to solve within an hour, so the solutions likely arent very complex.

- Write a program that will proper-case any word provided
- Write a program that somehow incoporates fibbonacci (they usually put a spin on "calculate the fib sequence up to x")

Brush up on general computer science concepts and know how to solve common problems in your language of choice (e.g. writing a fib program, manipulating strings, using data structures)

## Final Technical Interview

You may have more than one round of the initial technical interview, it depends on the company. But eventually you will have a final interview. This interview will either be in-person or zoom, and will likely last 3+ hours. They will be getting to know all aspects of you - from your problem solving skills, behavioral skills, and how you "fit" in with the overall team culture.

You will likely have a live problem to solve for one of hours you are there, if not more. Follow the same tips I give for the live problem in the initial interview, it will be essentially the same - but maybe with more scope since they can have more time.

You will also get questions involving your behavioral skills. These can be questions such as:

- Tell me about the most challenging person you have ever interacted with
- Describle a situation where you had many deadlines you had to meet. What steps did you take to get them all done?

I recommend having a 60 second story ready to go for the most common of these questions

They may ask you to describe yourself - specifically your strengths and weaknesses. Many people are hesitant to say what their "weaknesses" are, but that is a trap. This is an opportunity to show modesty and show how you are improving on those opportunities. Ensure you have at least 1-2 opportunities on your mind, and how you may go about improving them (or how you are already doing so)

They may also ask questions about the company. I kinda think they want to see how easy it might be to indoctronate someone into the company culture cult, but you just have to play along unfortunately. Research the company page, and find 1-2 facts about the company you find interesting that you can recite if they ask you. Often, these pages will have a "our philosophies" page where it lists the bs things that "make their culture". Either memorize them, or memorize one that you particularly like.

(sorry i am feeling particularily spicy about the subject of interviewing lol)
